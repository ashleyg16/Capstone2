    "Problem Statement: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has an Aviation Accident Database that contains information about civil aviation accidents and incidents that they investigate within the United States, its territories and international waters. For this Project, we will specifically be looking at airplane accidents for the 20 years from 2002 to 2021. The operations included are scheduled Part 121: Air Carrier, which includes most passenger airlines, as well as Part 135: Small Carrier for both commuter and ‘air taxi’ small aircraft. This dataset does not include aircraft accidents where the aircraft involved was amateur built."
